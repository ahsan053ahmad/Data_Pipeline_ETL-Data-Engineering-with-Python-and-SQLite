# Data_Pipeline_ETL-Data-Engineering-with-Python-and-SQLite
This repository contains a hands-on data engineering lab focused on developing a lightweight ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and SQLite. The assignment required ingesting structured CSV files, transforming the data using Python and Pandas, and loading it into a normalized SQLite database.
